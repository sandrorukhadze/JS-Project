    <p id="media_p">The jukebox (a coin-operated record-player) was invented by the Pacific Phonograph Company in 1889
        by its managers Louis Glass and his partner William S. Arnold.[11] The first was installed at the Palais Royale
        Saloon, San Francisco on November 23, 1889, becoming an overnight sensation.[12]
        The advent of the jukebox fueled the Prohibition-era boom in underground illegal speakeasy bars, which needed
        music but could not afford a live band and needed precious space for paying customers.[13] Webster Hall stayed
        open, with rumors circulating of Al Capone's involvement and police bribery.
        From about 1900 to 1920, working class Americans would gather at honky tonks or juke joints to dance to music
        played on a piano or a jukebox. With the repeal of Prohibition in February 1933, nightclubs were revived, such
        as New York's 21 Club, Copacabana, El Morocco, and the Stork Club. These nightclubs featured big bands.
        During America's Prohibition, new speakeasies and nightclubs appeared on a weekly basis. Texas Guinan opened and
        ran many, and had many padlocked by the police. Harlem had its own clubs including the Cotton Club. Midtown New
        York had a string of nightclubs, many named after bandleaders such as Paul Whiteman, Vincent Lopez, and Roger
        Wolfe Kahn who opened Le Perroquet de Paris at a cost of $250,000. It was billed as America's most beautiful and
        sophisticated nightclub and featured the young Kahn and his band most evenings.[14]</p>
