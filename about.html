        <div id="p_about">In the United States, New York increasingly became the national capital for tourism and
            entertainment. Grand hotels were built for upscale visitors. New York's theater district gradually moved
            northward during this half century, from The Bowery up Broadway through Union Square and Madison Square,
            settling around Times Square at the end of the 19th century. Stars such as Edwin Booth and Lillian
            Russell were among the early Broadway performers. Prostitutes served a wide variety of clientele, from
            sailors on leave to playboys. The first nightclubs appeared in New York City in the 1840s and 1850s,
            including McGlory's, and the Haymarket. They enjoyed a national reputation for vaudeville, live music, and
            dance. They tolerated unlicensed liquor, commercial sex, and gambling cards, chiefly Faro. Practically
            all gambling was illegal in the city (except upscale horseracing tracks), and regular payoffs to political
            and police leadership was necessary. Prices were high and they were patronized by an upscale audience.
            Timothy Gilfoyle called them "the first nightclubs". By contrast, Owney Geoghegan ran the toughest nightclub
            in New York from 1880 to 1883. It catered to a downscale clientele and besides the usual illegal
            liquor, gambling, and prostitution, it featured nightly fistfights and occasional shootings, stabbings, and
            police raids. Webster Hall is credited as the first modern nightclub, being built in 1886 and starting
            off as a "social hall", originally functioning as a home for dance and political activism events.
            Reisenweber's Cafe is credited for introducing jazz and cabaret to New Yorkers.
